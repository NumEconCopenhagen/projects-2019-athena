This project investigates different aspects of women's pay over time. This includes the following: women's share of men's pay, number of women employed full-time vs. part-time as well as women's employment frequency. The purpose is to explore whether these the latter two aspects can explain the former. In order to do so, we conduct the following steps. First, we export data on women's share of men's pay from Danmarks Statistik. Then, we merge this data table with another exported data set from DST showing women's employment frequency and subsequently the share of women who are full-time and part-time employed. Finally, we perform relevant calculations and present our findings graphically.
