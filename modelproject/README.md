# Modelproject

Our project is titled "Solving the Solow model with Total Factor Productivity (TFP)" and is about solving of the classic Solow model first. Then we extend the Sollow model with TFP-function and discover lower steadystate.

The results of the project can be seen from running ModelProject6.ipynb.

Dependencies: Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation the project requires no further installations.
